# tRNA databse
This folder contains the tRNA transcript sequences that are used for alignment of the reads generated by tRNA sequencing.
The human sequences have been masked based on an objective of minimizing alignment to multiple codons i.e. using these masked sequences should result in improved alignment specificity.
