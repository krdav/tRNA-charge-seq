Both images are of the same gel.

The gel was made to show RNA integrity after ended incubation time for the tRNA aminoacylation half-life samples taken over a 40h time period.

Well content from left to right:
Ladder, no incubation, rep1, rep2, rep3, rep4, no incubation, rep1, rep2, rep3, rep4

With the left set of replicates loading 4 ug RNA and the right set loading 1.5 ug.
The "no incubation" sample was taken prior to incubation and frozen and thus shows the RNA integrity before starting incubation.
The RNA ladder used is NEB Low Range ssRNA Ladder (N0364S):
