# Analysis of unmasked vs. masked reference alignment and adapter barcode bias
A pool of tRNA was processed with all 9 barcoded adapters to give a set of 9 samples.
These samples were then processed and aligned either with or without using masked tRNA reference sequences (for how masked tRNAs were made see `../alignment-opti`).
Comparisons are made to show the differences between these alignments.
Barcode bias is then assessed using the masked reference alignment results.
