# Linear range of tRNA charge quantification

This folder hosts an analysis of samples with tRNAs titrated to cover a large range of charge (charge <=> percent acylated).
It shows that charge measurements are quantitative with variance of a few percentage points and that the barcoded adapters are mostly unbiased.
See the Jupyter notebook for more details.
