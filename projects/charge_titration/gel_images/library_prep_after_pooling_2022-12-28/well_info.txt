These images show the gel isolation steps of the library prep after tRNA isolation as well as the cut gel after isolation of the desired fragment.

The pooled adapter barcoded tRNA samples are shown in the "tRNA_pooled.jpg".
Well content from left to right:
RNA ladder, no adapter tRNA size marker, P1, P2, ..., P9
With P1, .., P9 being the tRNA pools after pooling adapter barcoded samples.


The cDNA after RT PCR is shown in "cDNA.jpg".
Well content from left to right:
RNA ladder, P1, P2, ..., P9, RT no template control, RT no insert control

The RNA ladder used is NEB Low Range ssRNA Ladder (N0364S):

The library DNA resulting from 10 cycles of PCR to attach Illumina adapters is shown in "library-PCR_10-cycles.jpg".
Well content from left to right:
DNA ladder, P1, P2, ..., P9
Same order for "library-PCR_12-cycles.jpg" and "library-PCR_14-cycles.jpg" but using 12, 14 PCR cycles respectively.

The library DNA after pooling and purifying the DNA from cycle 10 and 12 is shown in "library-PCR_10-12-cycles-mix.jpg".
Well content from left to right:
DNA ladder, P1, P2, ..., P9

The DNA ladder used is Ultra Low Range DNA Ladder (10597012):
