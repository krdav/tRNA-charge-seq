These images show the tRNA isolation gel from the 9 charge titration samples and the gel after being cut to isolate the tRNA fraction.

Well content from left to right:
Ladder, p100, p85, p70, p55, p40, p25, p10, p0, p0 90m, Blank, Ladder

p100 = 100% intact
p85 = 85% intact + 15% deacylated
etc.
p0 90m is a control sample and was not used

The RNA ladder used is NEB Low Range ssRNA Ladder (N0364S):
