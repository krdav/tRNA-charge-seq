# Data processing example

This folder contains a complete example showing how to process tRNA sequencing data using the functions of this repository.
The `data` folder will host the results of this processing and before processing starts only contains one folder for the raw reads (called `raw_fastq`).

As you see the on Github the `data` folder is not fully populated with results from the processing to minimize the repo size.
Though some relevant plotting output is available, the complete processing results should be generated locally by downloading the repo, installing the required dependencies and running the steps described in the `process_data.ipynb` notebook.
