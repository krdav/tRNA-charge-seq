# Alignment optimization using masked reference sequences

Here, a subset of human tRNA samples are used to test alignment performance and generate masked reference sequences based on alignment mismatches caused by tRNA sequence modifications.
A grid search is employed to test different parameters controlling sequence masking and a final version of masked reference sequences are chosen based on alignment performance.
